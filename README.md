## About Me
 I have been in the Customer Service Industry for about 5 years now. I'm looking to pivot careers. I've always wanted to get in the tech industry but confused on where to go. When I came across data analytics I was extremely interested and wanted to learn more. Outside of work, I like to read, paint, and I'm currently obsessed with theBoys on PrimeVideo. 
  
  Goals: 
    
1.  Become proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel.
1.   If there is a position available, I would like to become a Real Time Analyst at my job.
1.  If the position isn't available then I would like to get a job as a Data Analyst.

This photo inspires me for this cohort because I've been nervous about this class. I'm in a completely new environment and I'm starting from scratch. This isn't something I've had to do for a long time. A part of me comes up with thousands of what-if scenarios on why me changing careers won't work. However, I will never know if it will work if I don't even try.
