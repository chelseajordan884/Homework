CHELSEA
  I have been in the Customer Service Industry for about 5 years now. I'm looking to pivot careers. I've always wanted to get in the tech industry but confused on where to go. When I came across data analytics I was extremely interested and wanted to learn more. Outside of work, I like to read, paint, and I'm currently obsessed with theBoys on PrimeVideo. 
  Goals:
    1. Become proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel
    2. I want to become a Real Time Analyst at my job after this program
    3. I don't know what exactly I will want to do after becoming a Real Time Analyst, but I would assume I would want an actual Data Analyst Position

This photo inspires me for this cohort because I've been nervous about this class. I'm in a completely new environment and I'm starting from scratch. This isn't something I've had to do for a long time. A part of me comes up with thousands of what-if scenarios on why me changing careers won't work. However, I will never know if it will work if I don't even try.
